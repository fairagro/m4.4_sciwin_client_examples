# SciWIn Client Examples
This repo provides all [SciWIn Client](https://github.com/fairagro/m4.4_sciwin_client) Examples from the [Documentation](https://fairagro.github.io/m4.4_sciwin_client/).

## [Getting started example](https://github.com/fairagro/m4.4_sciwin_client_demo_basic/tree/complete_run)
The getting started example is the most basic example provided with SciWIn Client. It creates a simple two-step-workflow without using containerization. It is made to get familiar with the basic capabilities of the `tool create` and `workflow` commands.

## [Advanced example](https://github.com/fairagro/m4.4_sciwin_client_demo/tree/complete_run)
The advanced example provides a real world use case using data from the german elections 2025 for the city of brunswick. Herein containerization is used and it is much more focused on how a real project will look like compared to the basic example. The workflow is a complex multiple-step operation which is built in two iterations.
